                        Reunion Literary Editor (RLE) is a software package written for someone who, upon
                        starting to write a book, finds themselves going off on a tangent about some random
                        character’s backstory and then going off on more tangents beyond that. Traditional
                        writing tools allow you to plan out and organize your plots, worlds, and characters. RLE
                        allows you to do it in whatever chaotic way suits your fancy.

                        Want to arrange a dozen different planning documents on your screen all at once? You can
                        do that with RLE. Don’t try sticking pins into your monitors though. They weren’t
                        designed for that. Masking tape could work though. For legal reasons, that was a joke.
                    </p>
                    <p class="bcw-text">
                        RLE is designed to preserve your work. Any text you delete can be recovered. Delete a
                        chapter out of a story? You can get it back. All of your work is autosaved every minute.
                        Why does it do this? Because I don’t want anyone to get the idea that anything they
                        deleted will stay deleted forever. I can’t guarantee that. Someone can download a tool
                        like <a href="https://github.com/pawlaszczyk/fqlite">this SQLite toolkit</a> and run it on your story
                        database to find every embarrassing thing you wrote
                        about them and tried to delete later. Rather than giving you an illusion of safety, I
                        have fully embraced the idea that everything is permanent and incorporated that mindset
                        into RLE. It’s like how everything on the internet is permanent. Don’t jot down anything
                        you don’t want being found later.

                        A collection of stories typically fits into a series. Each book gets divided into chapters,
                        which can have
                        multiple scenes in them. Put all of your scenes into a single chapter or split everything up
                        into discrete
                        chunks. It’s up to you. Create an entire outline for your book and fill it out, or trash
                        everything and start
                        from scratch. Is something out of order? Drag it to the place it should be. Does that scene you
                        wrote for your
                        fantasy series actually make more sense in the sci-fi one? You can move it from one place to the
                        other
                        effortlessly.

                        work on the hardest part of the story writing process: the actual story writing. If you need
                        motivation, you
                        can see how many words you typed out in this session and how many pages that ends up being.
                        Ultimately, it’s
                        up to you to actually do the writing. Any requests to integrate so-called “AI” systems into RLE

                        Did you have a good idea for a part of your story, but you deleted it in an earlier draft? RLE
                        stores every version of every document you ever wrote. You can even tag each version for future
                        reference. Look at each version to see what changed, how much was added, and how much was
                        deleted. It took me over three years to go from the first draft of this scene to the final
                        version and thanks to the power of RLE I know exactly how I got from the beginning to the end.

                        Do you enjoy watching numbers go up? Or, down if you’re a really good editor? You can look at a
                        summary of
                        everything you’ve written including how many words that is, how many pages that is, and how long
                        it would take the
                        average person to read every last scrap of text you’ve ever written. I wouldn’t recommend
                        spending over 7 hours
                        reading all of my ramblings though.

                        As I said before, everything you’ve ever written gets saved forever even if you’ve deleted it.
                        That’s great if you
                        want to recover that great idea you rejected on a bad day. It’s terrible if you’ve used RLE to
                        plan out a criminal
                        act and want to cover it up (please don’t commit crimes or use RLE to commit a crime).

                        deleted is buried in an old version of a deleted document you will be able to track it down
